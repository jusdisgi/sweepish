# sweepish
Basically a Ferris Sweep with a Seeed XIAO nrf52840 and Choc switches. My first ever attempt at PCB design.

I watched Joe Scotto's YouTube video on KiCad and figured I would try to replicate my own keyboard (a Sweep Bling LP from Keebmaker) without looking at any existing board designs. Well, except the 3x3 macropad in the video of course.
I also wanted to use the XIAO BLE because I just ordered some.
I feel like it came out pretty well for a first attempt. I hope to have some more knowledgeable people take a look and tell me how I can do better.
